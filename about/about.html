                           <h1>Dame Vivienne Isabel Westwood</h1>
                           <p><b>Dame Vivienne Isabel Westwood DBE RDI</b> <i>(née Swire; 8 April 1941 – 29 December 2022)</i> was an
                              English fashion designer and businesswoman, largely responsible for bringing modern punk
                              and new wave fashions into the mainstream. In 2022, Sky Arts ranked her the 4th most
                              influential artist in Britain of the last 50 years.
                              <br><br>
                              Westwood came to public notice when she made clothes for the boutique that she and Malcolm
                              McLaren ran on King's Road, which became known as Sex. Their ability to synthesize
                              clothing and music shaped the 1970s UK punk scene, which included McLaren's band, the Sex
                              Pistols. She viewed punk as a way of "seeing if one could put a spoke in the system".

                              Westwood opened four shops in London and eventually expanded throughout Britain and the
                              world, selling a varied range of merchandise, some of which promoted her political causes
                              such as the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, climate change and civil rights groups.

                           <h1>Early years</h1>
                           <p>Westwood was born in the village of Tintwistle, Cheshire, on 8 April 1941. She
                              was the daughter of Gordon Swire and Dora Swire (née Ball), who had married two years
                              previously, two weeks after the outbreak of the Second World War. At the time of
                              Vivienne's birth, her father was employed as a storekeeper in an aircraft factory; he had
                              previously worked as a greengrocer.
                              <br><br>
                              In 1958, her family moved to Harrow, Greater London. Westwood took a jewelry and
                              silversmith course at the University of Westminster, then known as the Harrow Art
                              School, but left after one term, saying: "I didn't know how a working-class girl like
                              me could possibly make a living in the art world". After taking a job in a factory and
                              studying at a teacher-training college, she became a primary-school teacher. During this
                              period, she created her own jewelry, which she sold at a stall on Portobello Road.

                              In 1962, she met Derek Westwood, a Hoover factory apprentice, in Harrow. They married
                              on 21 July 1962; Westwood made her own wedding dress. In 1963, she gave birth to a
                              son, Benjamin.
                           </p>
                           <img class="img-fluid pt-5 pb-5"
                              src="/assets/viviennewestwood/Vivienne-Westwood-portrait2.jpg" alt="Photo">
                           <p id>Westwood's marriage to Derek ended after she met Malcolm McLaren. Westwood and McLaren
                              moved to Thurleigh Court in Balham, where their son Joseph Corré was born in 1967.
                              Westwood continued to teach until 1971 and also created clothes which McLaren designed.
                              McLaren became manager of the punk band the Sex Pistols, and subsequently the two garnered
                              attention as the band wore Westwood's and McLaren's designs.
                              <br><br>
                              Westwood was one of the architects of the punk fashion phenomenon of the 1970s, saying "I
                              was messianic about punk, seeing if one could put a spoke in the system in some way".
                              Westwood's emergence as a designer who made garments that reflected the economic, social,
                              and political contexts of 1970s Britain coincided with a disillusioned youth, who
                              developed a unique style of dress and musical expression which was instantly identifiable
                              through its aesthetic and sound.

                              Westwood's boutique, originally managed with McLaren, was a meeting place for early
                              members of the London punk scene. The boutique regularly changed names and interior design
                              through the 1970s to fit with collections and design inspirations. It remains in its
                              original location at 430 Kings Road, Chelsea, London (under the name Worlds End since
                              1979, following a short period of closure in the 1980s) to this day.
                           </p>
                           <p id="block">McLaren and Westwood were keen entrepreneurs, and their designs sold in their boutique -
                              named Let It Rock, Too Fast To Live Too Young To Die, Sex, and subsequently Seditionares -
                              helped to define and market the punk look at the exact moment that it exploded in
                              popularity on the streets of London. Westwood's designs during the Punk Era and
                              thereafter were informed by historicism; the V&A describing Westwood as “a meticulous
                              researcher”. Westwood began challenging gender norms and promoting experimentation in
                              her designs, which at the outset were created in collaboration with McLaren.
                              <br><br>
                              Initially, Westwood created garments refencing the dress of the 1950s Teddy Boys, which
                              were worn by McLaren. Upon opening Let It Rock in 1971, the first incarnation of Westwood
                              and McLaren's boutique, early creations for the shop incorporated such influences
                              reminiscent of the youth subculture fashions of the 1950s. Inspired by the rebellious
                              nature of the 1950s youth, Let It Rock referenced the clothing, music, and décor of the
                              immediate postwar era.

                              In 1972, Let It Rock was refashioned into Too Fast To Live Too Young To Die, in homage to
                              the death of James Dean. Though design references for garments retailed under Too Fast To
                              Live Too Young To Die focussed on the rocker aesthetic of the 1960s, the boutique
                              still sold Teddy Boy inspired garments under the Let It Rock label. The new
                              politically leaning design inspirations for Too Fast To Live Too Young To Die were
                              conveyed through Westwood's sleeveless T-shirts, bearing various statements such as ‘PERV’
                              and ‘ROCK’, created using a combination of safety pins, chicken bones, and glitter glue.
